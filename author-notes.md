# Author Notes

## TODOs

## Future Tasks

### iOS

- Add flavors
- Add Universal Links
- i18n - https://docs.flutter.dev/accessibility-and-localization/internationalization#localizing-for-ios-updating-the-ios-app-bundle
- Firebase - Crashlytics
- Sentry

## Code shrinking / Tree-shaking / Resource shrinking / Obfuscation / Optimization

### Android

- References:
  - https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code
  - https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9848633
- No action is needed.  
  `minifyEnabled`, `shrinkResources`, `proguardFile` already configured for `release` buildType in [`flutter.groovy`]
- No need to upload Native Debug Symbols.  
  `libapp.so` and `libflutter.so` already included in App Bundle at `/base/lib/<arch-variants>/`.  
  Adding `android.defaultConfig.ndk.debugSymbolLevel = 'FULL'` to `build.gradle` has no effect in size of the App Bundle.  
  This might only require if we have any extra Native library.
- No need to upload deobfuscation mapping files.  
  `proguard.map` already included in App Bundle at `/BUNDLE-METADATA/com.android.tools.build.obfuscation/`.

## Error Reporting Services
